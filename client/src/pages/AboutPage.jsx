        <p className="text-base font-normal leading-relaxed">
          Poetica was born from a simple idea â€” that poetry deserves a home. A
          place where thoughts don't just disappear into forgotten notebooks,
          but find a community that listens, feels, and connects. In a world
          that scrolls too fast, Poetica invites you to slow down â€” to read, to
          write, and to breathe between verses. Poetry has always been a quiet
          refuge â€” a way to make sense of emotions that rarely fit into
          conversation. Yet, so many poets and dreamers never find a space that
          feels both personal and open. Poetica bridges that gap. It's built not
          for perfection, but for expression â€” for every whispered draft, raw
          emotion, and polished line that deserves to be seen. Our vision is
          simple: to nurture a community that celebrates words, vulnerability,
          and the art of slowing down. A space where creativity becomes a shared
          heartbeat â€” not a competition, but a conversation.

          Feel. Let your words find their rhythm here.
